sayNumber
=========

A Haskell program that prints out strings for numbers.

Got this program together on a whim, but I did not want to lose it.
If you have never checked out http://www.compileonline.com/ I would check it out.

I just wish I could save stuff easily there.
I often find myself just playing around on the site on my chromebook.  A fun way to code every day.
